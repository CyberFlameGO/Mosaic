# Mosaic
A handy application for making mosaic out of images<br/>
!NOTE: Mosaic starting from v1.5 is 64-bit only. You need to compile the app for 32-bit by yourself if you have a 32-bit system somehow.

## Usage

Put any composite `.png`'s in the /images/ folder. It needs to be **directly in the same folder as the app.**<br/>
Put one source.png in the folder **with the app**<br/>

Run the app.

Edit the config if anything's wrong.

Press `F11` to make an image of the mosaic and save it to /screenshots/. Don't worry, even if the viewport is bigger than your screen, F11 **WILL** work.
Press `ESC` to close the app when finished.

## Config

`max_clones` - Sets max amount of composites on image.<br/>
`precision_point` - Sets amount of precision, here the size of one image. Smaller = more precise.
`debug_info` - debug info stats
